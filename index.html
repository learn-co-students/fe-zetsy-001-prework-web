            <p class="basicParagraph">Jewelry in the Americas has an ancient history. Beginning as far
            back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest drilled
            and shaped multicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants.
            Olivella shell beads, dating from 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada;
            bone, antler, and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were
            found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from
            Lake Superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved in
            Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE. <a
