			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>Mary Wanesia is Jeweler, an Arizona native, and a member of the Navajo tribe. She specializes in creating beautiful contemporary takes on the tradional adornments worn by Navajo in ceramonies and in daily life.</p>

			<p>Jewelry in the Americas has an ancient history. Beginning as far back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest drilled and shaped multicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants. Olivella shell beads, dating from 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada; bone, antler, and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from Lake Superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved in Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE. <a href="#">Learn more</a>.</p>
